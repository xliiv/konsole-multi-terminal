UPDATE on the project status.
=============================

This project is not maintained anymore.

The reason is that at the moment I am not using KDE and so have little 
interest in it.

The next work item would be to apply these changes to the latest version 
of Konsole and try to make them effective upstream.

Multi Terminal implementation
=============================

This repository is the "vanilla" konsole application to which a new feature
is being added.

The new feature is a different split behavior in which a terminal can be
split into an indefinite amount of other terminals (horizontally and
vertically). Note that this is different than the current "Split View"
implementation.

This repository will be kept aligned with the master repository at KDE,
plus it will contain the changes for the implementation of the
multi-terminal. It serves as a "personal" branch on which to save
unfinished work.


Konsole - KDE's Terminal Emulator
==================================

Konsole is a terminal program for KDE.

As well as being a standalone program, it is also used by other KDE programs
such as the Kate editor and KDevelop development environment to provide easy
access to a terminal window. Konsole's features and usage are explained and
illustrated in the Konsole handbook, which can be accessed by browsing to
"help:/konsole" in Konqueror.


Directory Structure
===================

 /doc/user      README files, primarily for advanced users, explaining various
                aspects of Konsole such as fonts and keyboard handling
                in-depth.

 /doc/developer README files and resources for developers of Konsole. This
                includes information on the design of Konsole's internals and
                the VT100 terminal on which Konsole's emulation is based.

 /src           Source code for Konsole, including the embedded versions of
                Konsole which are used in Kate, KDevelop and others.

 /desktop       .desktop files for Konsole, used to launch the program
                from KDE's various menus and other application launchers.

 /data          Data files for use with Konsole as well as the keyboard setup
                and color schemes provided with Konsole.
